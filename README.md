# Geodata-Toolchain
IAAA GeoData Toolchain

This is a project focused on creating an ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Load) system oriented to geolocated data with strong focus on the transformation filters.
The project uses PostgreSQL / Postgis DB system as an operation center due to it's high support of that kind of data.

The idea is to be able to create a simple workflow in python to define a series of filters to apply to that data, from the extraction from different sources, to the load in an explotaition DB.

## Update 2019-04-03
After using this repository to prototype several ideas and to make some tests on different branches, we have taken what we have learned and we have moved the development of this library to a new repository: <https://github.com/iaaa-lab/gdtc>.

For now, we will keep this repository as a reference, but sooner or later it will be erased.
