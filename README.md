# Geodata-Toolchain
IAAA GeoData Toolchain

This is a project focused on creating an ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Load) system oriented to geolocated data with strong focus on the transformation filters.
The project uses PostgreSQL / Postgis DB system as an operation center due to it's high support of that kind of data.

The idea is to be able to create a simple workflow in python to define a series of filters to apply to that data, from the extraction from different sources, to the load in an explotaition DB.
